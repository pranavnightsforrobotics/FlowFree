# must generate color clauses
# must generate directional clauses
# must create clause -> graph
# must create graph cycle detection split each series of nodes into their own graph and then do DAGS construction on these graphs
# if impossible then we have a cycle, if possible then no cycle, make direction static incase -> <- collision exists!!
# must create new clauses to avoid continued cycle creation
